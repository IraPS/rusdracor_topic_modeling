## This is a repository for the project "Topic Modeling 200 Years of Russian Drama"

### The goal of the project is to perform a TM on 90 Russian plays written from 1747 to 1943. The algorithms can be improved or modified and reapplied to the updated corpus.

Here you can find the data and scripts used in the work.

The processed TEI-xml files with excluded proper names of the characters can be found here: https://github.com/IraPS/rusdracor_topic_modeling/tree/master/tei_without_proper_names

The preprocessed corpus of 90 Russian plays: https://github.com/IraPS/rusdracor_topic_modeling/tree/master/corpora. Each folder has subfolders **byauthor**, **bycharacter**, **byplay**, **bysex**. 

The final version that was used for the project is located in this folder: https://github.com/IraPS/rusdracor_topic_modeling/tree/master/corpora/speech_corpus_no_prop_char_names_ONLY_NOUNS. It also includes subfolders **bygenre** and **byyear_range**.
